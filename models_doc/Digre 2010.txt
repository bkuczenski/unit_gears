mother fucking paper doesn't report the size of the damn trawl.

(M/T J. Bergvoll, length 57 m, BT 1499, HP 3900)

Dual trawl

experimental trawl stretched length was 9.66+9.66 || codend 8.35m + 4.21m || TrL = 19.5m
traditional trawl stretched length was 8.40m + 14.00m || codend 10.90 m   || TrL = 22.4m

Sala EU Report Figure 107 correlates TrL to TrW

but again we have the problem that the params are too small to interpolate



Anyway, 47629 kg caught over a total of 2x16 hauls = 1488 kg per haul

310.7 +- 130 kg per trawl-hour
for these trawls of mysterious dimension.


[ 1 hour *

this is no good, with no comparable measure of gear
